# Portfolio
This a portfolio site that will feature my work.

## The Project
This project was to showcase my skills in HTML and CSS. My intention was to build a website that will serve as a portfolio for my projects. It has sections where a user can click on a specific project of mine. It also has sections where my resume can be found and my github information can be found. 

## Technologies 
I used HTML and CSS to build this project. I used flex-box for my layout and google fonts for the font-styles. I used a drone image, which I shot for the header image and stock images for my project sections. 

## Future Development
I will continue to build on this page, adding my most successful projects and fixing bugs.
